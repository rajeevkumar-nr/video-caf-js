## Installation Process

### Option 1: Install via NPM/Yarn

Install the package using your preferred package manager:

**NPM:**
```bash
npm install @newrelic/video-caf
```

**Yarn:**
```bash
yarn add @newrelic/video-caf
```

### Option 2: Direct Script Include (Without NPM)

For quick integration without a build system, include the tracker directly in your receiver HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- New Relic CAF Tracker -->
    <script src="path/to/newrelic-caf.min.js"></script>

    <!-- CAF Receiver SDK -->
    <script src="//www.gstatic.com/cast/sdk/libs/caf_receiver/v3/cast_receiver_framework.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <cast-media-player></cast-media-player>

    <script>
      const receiverContext = cast.framework.CastReceiverContext.getInstance();

      // Retrieve these credentials by following the Streaming Video & Ads onboarding steps in New Relic Browser (one.newrelic.com)
      const options = {
        info: {
          licenseKey:    'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY',
          beacon:        'YOUR_BEACON_URL',
          applicationID: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_ID',
        },
      };

      // Initialize tracker BEFORE calling receiverContext.start()
      const tracker = new CAFTracker(receiverContext, options);

      receiverContext.start();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Setup Steps:**

1. **Get Configuration** - Visit [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) and follow the Streaming Video & Ads onboarding flow to get your `licenseKey`, `beacon`, and `applicationID`.
2. **Integrate** - Include the script in your receiver and initialize with your configuration **before** calling `receiverContext.start()`.

## Prerequisites

Before using the tracker, ensure you have:

- **New Relic Account** - Active New Relic account with valid credentials (`beacon`, `applicationID`, `licenseKey`)
- **CAF Receiver SDK** - The Cast Application Framework Receiver SDK loaded in your receiver page
- **Chromecast Device or Emulator** - A real Chromecast device or the [Chromecast Device Emulator](https://github.com/ajaidanial/chromecast-device-emulator) for local testing

## Usage

### Getting Your Configuration

Before initializing the tracker, obtain your New Relic configuration:

1. Log in to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)
2. Navigate to the video agent onboarding flow
3. Copy your credentials: `licenseKey`, `beacon`, and `applicationID`

### Basic Setup

```javascript
import CAFTracker from '@newrelic/video-caf';

// 1. Get the CastReceiverContext singleton
const receiverContext = cast.framework.CastReceiverContext.getInstance();

// 2. Retrieve these credentials by following the Streaming Video & Ads onboarding steps in New Relic Browser (one.newrelic.com)
const options = {
  info: {
    licenseKey:    'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY',
    beacon:        'bam.nr-data.net',
    applicationID: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_ID',
  },
};

// 3. Initialize tracker BEFORE receiverContext.start()
const tracker = new CAFTracker(receiverContext, options);

// 4. Start the receiver
receiverContext.start();
```

> **Important:** The tracker must be initialized before calling `receiverContext.start()` to ensure all playback events are captured from the beginning of the session.

### Advanced Configuration

```javascript
const options = {
  info: {
    licenseKey:    'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY',
    beacon:        'YOUR_BEACON_URL',
    applicationID: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_ID',
  },
  config: {
    qoeAggregate: true,        // Enable QoE event aggregation
    qoeIntervalFactor: 2,      // Send QoE events every 2 harvest cycles
  },
  customData: {
    contentTitle:     'My Video Title',
    customPlayerName: 'MyCustomPlayer',
    customAttribute:  'customValue',
  },
};

const tracker = new CAFTracker(receiverContext, options);
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Setting `contentTitle`

The `contentTitle` attribute is populated from the media metadata title if present. For best results, explicitly set it via `customData`:

```javascript
const tracker = new CAFTracker(receiverContext, {
  info: {
    licenseKey:    'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY',
    beacon:        'YOUR_BEACON_URL',
    applicationID: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_ID',
  },
  customData: {
    contentTitle: 'My Video Title',
  },
});
```

If your content changes dynamically (e.g., a playlist or queue):

```javascript
tracker.sendOptions({
  customData: {
    contentTitle: 'New Video Title',
  },
});
```

### 2. Setting `userId`

Track analytics per user by setting a user identifier:

```javascript
// Set userId during initialization
const tracker = new CAFTracker(receiverContext, {
  info: {
    licenseKey:    'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY',
    beacon:        'YOUR_BEACON_URL',
    applicationID: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_ID',
  },
  customData: {
    userId: 'user-12345',
  },
});

// Or set userId separately after initialization
tracker.setUserId('user-12345');
```

### 3. Adding Custom Attributes

Enrich your analytics data with deployment-specific attributes:

```javascript
const tracker = new CAFTracker(receiverContext, {
  info: {
    licenseKey:    'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY',
    beacon:        'YOUR_BEACON_URL',
    applicationID: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_ID',
  },
  customData: {
    contentTitle:     videoMetadata.title,
    userId:           currentUser.id,
    subscriptionTier: 'premium',
    contentProvider:  'studio-abc',
    region:           'us-west-2',
    appVersion:       '2.1.0',
  },
});
```

**Use these attributes in New Relic queries:**

```sql
-- Analyze content starts by subscription tier
SELECT count(*) FROM VideoAction WHERE actionName = 'CONTENT_START'
FACET subscriptionTier SINCE 1 day ago

-- Monitor bitrate by region
SELECT average(contentBitrate) FROM VideoAction
FACET region SINCE 1 hour ago
```

### 4. Gradual Rollout with Feature Flags

When deploying to production, use feature flags to enable the tracker gradually. This helps you:

- Validate data collection without impacting all users
- Monitor performance impact at scale
- Catch issues before full deployment
- Control monitoring costs

```javascript
// Example using a feature flag
const rolloutPercentage = 5; // Start with 5% of users

function shouldEnableTracking(userId) {
  // Simple percentage-based rollout
  const hash = userId.split('').reduce((acc, char) => acc + char.charCodeAt(0), 0);
  return (hash % 100) < rolloutPercentage;
}

const receiverContext = cast.framework.CastReceiverContext.getInstance();

// Only initialize tracker if user is in rollout
if (shouldEnableTracking(currentUser.id)) {
  const tracker = new CAFTracker(receiverContext, {
    info: {
      licenseKey: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY',
      beacon: 'YOUR_BEACON_URL',
      applicationID: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
    },
    customData: {
      contentTitle: videoMetadata.title,
      userId: currentUser.id,
      rolloutGroup: `${rolloutPercentage}%`,  // Track which rollout group
    },
  });
}

receiverContext.start();
```

**Recommended Rollout Schedule:**

| Phase | Percentage | Duration | Validation |
|-------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Initial | 5% | 2-3 days | Verify data flowing to New Relic |
| Early | 15% | 3-5 days | Check data quality and performance |
| Expansion | 25% | 5-7 days | Validate across device types |
| Majority | 50% | 1-2 weeks | Monitor at scale |
| Full | 100% | Ongoing | Complete deployment |

## Configuration Options

### `options.info` (required)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `licenseKey` | string | New Relic Browser license key |
| `beacon` | string | Data endpoint — use `bam.nr-data.net` |
| `applicationID` | string | New Relic application ID |

### QoE (Quality of Experience) Settings

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `qoeAggregate` | boolean | `false` | Enable Quality of Experience event aggregation. Set to `true` to collect QoE metrics like startup time, buffering, and average bitrate. |
| `qoeIntervalFactor` | number | `1` | Controls QoE event frequency. A value of `N` sends QoE events once every N harvest cycles. Must be a positive integer. QoE events are always included on first and final harvest cycles. |

### Custom Data

Add custom attributes to all events:

```javascript
customData: {
  contentTitle:        'My Video Title',   // Override video title
  customPlayerName:    'MyPlayer',         // Custom player identifier
  customPlayerVersion: '1.0.0',           // Custom player version
  userId:              '12345',            // User identifier
  // Any additional custom attributes
}
```

> **Limit:** The maximum total number of custom attributes per event is **150**. Any attributes beyond this limit will be dropped.

> **Note:** There are special keywords reserved for default attributes (see [DATAMODEL.md](./DATAMODEL.md)). Please do not use these as custom attributes, as they will be dropped. Examples of reserved keywords include `actionName`, `contentId`, `contentTitle`, `playerName`, `playerVersion`, `viewSession`, `viewId`, and others listed in the data model documentation.

## API Reference

### Core Methods

#### `tracker.setUserId(userId)`

Set a unique identifier for the current user.

```javascript
tracker.setUserId('user-12345');
```

#### `tracker.setHarvestInterval(milliseconds)`

Configure how frequently data is sent to New Relic. Accepts values between 1000ms (1 second) and 300000ms (5 minutes).

```javascript
tracker.setHarvestInterval(30000); // Send data every 30 seconds
```

#### `tracker.sendCustom(actionName, state, attributes)`

Send a custom event with arbitrary attributes.

```javascript
tracker.sendCustom('CUSTOM_ACTION', 'state time', {
  test1: 'value1',
  test2: 'value2',
});
```

#### `tracker.sendOptions(options)`

Update custom data after initialization.

```javascript
tracker.sendOptions({
  customData: {
    contentTitle: 'New Video Title',
  },
});
```

### Example: Complete Integration

```javascript
import CAFTracker from '@newrelic/video-caf';

const receiverContext = cast.framework.CastReceiverContext.getInstance();

const tracker = new CAFTracker(receiverContext, {
  info: {
    licenseKey:    'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY',
    beacon:        'YOUR_BEACON_URL',
    applicationID: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_ID',
  },
  config: {
    qoeAggregate: true,
  },
  customData: {
    contentTitle: 'My Video',
    userId:       'user-12345',
  },
});

// Configure reporting interval
tracker.setHarvestInterval(30000);

receiverContext.start();
```

## Data Model

The tracker captures comprehensive video analytics across four event types:

- **VideoAction** — Playback events (start, pause, buffer, seek, rendition changes, heartbeats)
- **VideoAdAction** — Ad break events (ad start, quartile progress, completions)
- **VideoErrorAction** — Error events (playback failures, ad errors, network errors)
- **VideoCustomAction** — Custom events defined by your application

**Full Documentation:** See [DATAMODEL.md](./DATAMODEL.md) for the complete event and attribute reference.

## Known Limitations

- When a video `END` event fires, the `contentSrc` attribute is incorrect. This is due to how the Chromecast player clears media information before the event is emitted.
